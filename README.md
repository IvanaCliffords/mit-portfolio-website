## Description

This portfolio website consists of two pages (home and projects). Consists only of HTML and CSS. The header was imported from Bootstrap and modified to fit the goals of this webpages. I also imported two Google fonts and more than few Font Awesome icons.

## Roadmap of future improvements


* I would like to reduce my code: I know there must be a way to style the two-page website without 400 lines of CSS code
* I would like to use the reusable components:
  - I tried to use the Shadow DOM with custom header and it fell appart (maybe because that code and Bootstrap code overlapped in a way that's beyond my understanding)
  - I tried the same with footer and it almost worked, but it didn't allow me to style my links
* I would like to style it less like it's 2015 and more like it's 2021, and without using the divs that took million lines of code to style
* I would use both JavaScript and CSS to animate the elements 

## Special thanks
